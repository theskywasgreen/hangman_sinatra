# Hangman 
This is an implementation of the Hangman game using Sinatra. This project is part of [the Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/home) curriculum.

This version of the game requires the player to guess a film from IMDB's top 250 film list to add a little more enjoyment for the user. 
I have really focused on the front end of this game and I have added extra features that I think make the game a better user experience such as a button to pick a new film to guess, win/lose pages, and play again buttons on the win/lose pages.
I have also added an autofocus onto the letter input field so that the player does not have to click on the input box after every guess. It is these little things that I think make the game much more enjoyable to play.
